# ‚ö†Ô∏è Archive Notice üìö 2024/09

This repo contains my first website, built with Flask and hosted at connorData.Science. It was my initial dive into web development, which turned out to be more engaging than I anticipated.

>*üîß Initially, I wasn‚Äôt keen on web development, but this project changed my mind. I started with Flask to leverage my Python skills and attempted to manage multiple web apps with an application dispatcher. I never did finish my Covid data viz project though!*

>*üß† I've moved on to Next.js and TypeScript, which are more suited for web development than Python, which I found limiting. Python has too many niggles that don't quite do it for me.* 

>*üåç This project really opened my eyes to the whole tech stack. It's made me want to get good at everything, anything from frontend tweaks to backend, all the way to machine learning. My self-set goal (maybe a bit of a pipe dream) is to become a polymath in programming, good at everything. I know it's pretty crazy but would be so damn cool and I might as well aim high.*

I still have a personal website hosted at [connorData.Science](https://connorData.Science). I'm not open sourcing the code yet though, because my property! >:(

## Getting Started 

All Flask code is stored in `app.py`. All the HTML files are in `templates/` and all JS/CSS in `static/`

### Prerequisites

All of the requirements my website depends on is stored in `requirements.txt`, installable via:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

All you need to do to run it is to execute `app.py`. If not, then a simple
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py && flask run
```
is all you need to get this project running. 

Follow the URL outputted in the terminal to access the local web server.
